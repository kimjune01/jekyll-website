        Our Process
      </h3>
      <p class="large text-muted">
        Each project is a partnership led by someone who works directly with you. We start with a conversation about your goals, then develop a plan with you. <br> Depending on the project's current progress, this is how we break it down:
      </p>
      <ul class="text-muted">
        <li>
          <b>Discovery</b> — define possibilities and goals for the project
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>UX Prototype</b> — solidify the experience to build with your team and customers
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Build</b> — iterate upon the prototype for feedback from your potential customers, then improve
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Deployment</b> — operate and maintain the application for years to come; we can even help train your team
        </li>
      </ul>
